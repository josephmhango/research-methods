    "text": "From Normal to t-Distribution\nn the late 19th century, Francis Galton had popularised the bell-shaped curve — observing that traits like height tended to cluster symmetrically around a central value, with fewer observations as you moved away in either direction. He believed this was a natural law of heredity and variation.\nBut it was Carl Friedrich Gauss, decades earlier, who had formulated the mathematical structure of that bell. The normal distribution, or Gaussian distribution, provided a precise formula for how data should be distributed if randomness played out fairly. Crucially, that formula depends on two parameters: the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and the variance \\(\\sigma\\). In fact, the variance appears in the exponent of Gauss’s formula, governing the spread of the curve. The larger the variance, the wider the bell. This made variance not just a descriptor of spread, but a core component of the entire probability model.\nAnd so, in the world of Pearson and Galton, the assumption was simple: If you know the population variance, the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) follows:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\sim N\\left( \\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right)\n\\]\nFrom this assumption, you could do a bunch of stuff, like calculating the Z-score:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nAnd from there, determine how likely your sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) was, assuming a known population mean \\(\\mu\\). But this entire framework leans heavily on the assumption that \\(\\sigma\\) is known — that variance is a given constant, not something estimated from data. This is precisely what Gosset challenged. In most real-world situations, \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown. Therefore, Gosset decided to do away with that assumption. He replaced \\(\\sigma\\) with the actual sample standard deviation \\(s\\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nThis creates a ratio of two random variables — one for the sample mean, one for the estimated standard deviation — resulting in a wider, more cautious distribution: the t-distribution.",

He recognised that variance matters, and that when you don’t know it, you need a distribution that reflects that uncertainty. The t-distribution gave us a principled way to test hypotheses when data is scarce.\nToday, the t-test is one of the most widely used tools in science. It reminds us that good inference isn’t just about what we observe — it’s about how confident we are in what we don’t.\n\nIn the cellars of Guinness, Gosset brewed not just beer, but a new way of thinking about data.",

Fisher walked into — not a world of idealised variables on chalkboards, but muddy fields, inconsistent weather, and the unglamorous grind of crop yield records.\nIt was 1919, and Fisher had just taken a position at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, home to some of the oldest agricultural experiments in the world. Here, researchers had been testing fertilisers, seed varieties, and farming practices for decades. But their analysis of the results had become a guessing game, relying more on intuition than inference.\nFisher wasn’t content with that.

But this has two major flaws:\n\nIt’s inefficient: You perform multiple tests when you really just want one answer.\nIt’s dangerous: Each test increases your chance of a false positive. Do enough of them, and eventually, one will scream “significant” just by chance.\n\nFisher saw through this. Instead of asking Which two groups are different?, he asked:\n\nIs there evidence that not all group means are equal?\n\nA single question. One test.

But if one fertiliser truly boosted yields, the means would diverge, increasing the numerator and pushing the F-statistic higher.\nThis wasn’t just clever — it was radical.

Fisher was steeped in the work of Gauss, whose normal distribution described measurement error in astronomy and was later adopted by Galton to explain natural traits.\nThe formula for the normal curve involved the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), which quantified spread. In Pearson’s world, this was assumed known. Gosset challenged that, showing that when estimating variance from the data, the result was a distribution with heavier tails — the t-distribution.\nFisher extended this thinking. He understood that variance wasn’t just noise — it was a signal in itself. By analysing how total variation could be partitioned, he could infer whether treatment effects existed.\nIn this way, variance became more than a mathematical artefact — it became a lens through which to view structure.",

It tells us the total squared distance that the data points are from their group mean.\nWe don’t divide by \\(n - 1\\) yet — that’s what turns SS into variance. But by keeping it as a total, we can compare sources of variation before standardising them.\nIn ANOVA:\n\nSSB (Between): How far group means are from the overall mean\nSSW (Within): How scattered values are inside each group\nSST (Total): Total variation across all observations\n\nThen, dividing each SS by its degrees of freedom gives us Mean Squares (MS) — which are essentially variances.\nAnd the F-statistic is:\n\\[\nF = \\frac{MS_B}{MS_W} = \\frac{SS_B / (k - 1)}{SS_W / (N - k)}\n\\]\nThis ratio of two variances is what Fisher realised could detect true experimental effects beyond random variation.",

    "text": "Basic data types in R\nR works with different kinds of data objects, and each object has an associated type. These types determine what operations are possible and how the data is treated during analysis. All the data you create lives in the Global Environment, and it’s important to know what kind of data you’re working with.\nR is pretty good at guessing what type your data should be — but this can sometimes backfire. Think of R as a passive-aggressive butler: it tries to help, but doesn’t always tell you when it’s done something “helpful.” So, you should learn to check and control data types explicitly.",

The logic of correlation, for instance, assumed that the underlying variables were normally distributed. If not, the coefficient could be distorted, biased, even misleading. His early work relied on the assumption that nature, when measured, would fall obediently into the arms of the bell curve.\nBut here, in this messy field data, the bell curve had no place. The data could not be smoothed or standardised. They were counts, nothing more — frequencies of occurrence. Yet beneath those frequencies lay a pattern. The very idea of science is to determine whether a pattern is real or illusory. And so Pearson began to think.\nIf you couldn’t compare means, perhaps you could compare frequencies — not in the sense of variance, but in the sense of discrepancy. How different is what we observe from what we expect?\nAnd thus emerged one of the most brilliant — and most underappreciated — shifts in modern science.",

He devised a deceptively simple formula:\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n\\]\n\n\\(O_i\\) was the observed count in each category.\n\\(E_i\\) was the expected count, under the assumption of independence.\nSquaring the difference removed direction — a shortfall or an excess both became evidence.\nDividing by \\(E_i\\) scaled the contribution of each category, adjusting for the size of expectation.\n\nIn this sum, Pearson saw a universal measure of surprise. If the observations closely matched expectations, chi-square would be small. If they diverged wildly, the statistic would grow large.\nBut was it meaningful? Could he say when the result was too large to have arisen by chance?\nYes — and this is where Pearson’s mathematical gift became apparent. He derived the theoretical distribution of chi-square under the null hypothesis. He showed that, when the expected frequencies were large enough and the observations were independent, the statistic followed a specific pattern — what would become known as the chi-square distribution.\nIt was: - Bounded below at 0 (perfect match) - Right-skewed, especially with few categories - Unbounded above — allowing for arbitrarily large mismatches, though increasingly improbable\nThis distribution let Pearson calculate, for any given \\(X^2\\) value, the probability of observing such a result under the assumption of independence.\nIt was a revelation.

If that assumption fails, the coefficient can behave badly — inflating or hiding relationships.\nBut how do you test whether data is normal? One way, Pearson realised, was to bin the data into categories — say, intervals of values — and compare the observed frequencies with the probabilities predicted by a normal distribution.\nIn this way, the chi-square test became a way to evaluate how well continuous data conformed to a normal model. The logic was recursive. The chi-square test could test the assumptions required for the very methods Pearson had pioneered.\nIt was a beautiful moment of statistical self-reflection.

    "text": "Demonstrating Chi-Square in R with Real Datasets\n\nchi-square test of independence\nLet’s walk through the naturalist’s bird observations and answer the first question, that is; Are the species counts dependent on location or it doesnt matter? This requires us to test whether two categorical variables are independent (e.g., species vs location). For this, Karl came up with the chi-square test of independence, the more nuanced of two flavours of chi-square tests (we will show the other one below). It test requires us to make two-way tables as follows:\nStep 1: Create the observed table\n\n\nCode\nbird_counts &lt;- matrix(c(\n  30, 20,  # Glen Affric\n  25, 25,  # Glen Nevis\n  15, 35   # Rannoch Moor\n), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\nrownames(bird_counts) &lt;- c(\"Glen Affric\", \"Glen Nevis\", \"Rannoch Moor\")\ncolnames(bird_counts) &lt;- c(\"Golden Eagle\", \"Red Kite\")\nbird_counts\n\n\n             Golden Eagle Red Kite\nGlen Affric            30       20\nGlen Nevis             25       25\nRannoch Moor           15       35\n\n\nStep 2: Get row/column totals and compute expected values\nBefore computing the chi-square statistic, we need the expected values — the counts we’d expect in each cell if bird species and location were independent.\nYou might ask:\nWhy aren’t expected values just evenly split, like 0.5 for each cell?\nBecause the overall row and column totals aren’t evenly split. The expected count for each cell depends on both:\nHow many total birds are at each location (row totals), and\nHow many total birds belong to each species (column totals)\nFor example:\nGolden eagles make up 70 out of 150 birds → 46.7%\nRed kites make up 80 out of 150 birds → 53.3%\nWe use these proportions to distribute expectations across each location.\n\\[\nE_{ij} = \\frac{(\\text{Row Total}_i \\times \\text{Column Total}_j)}{\\text{Grand Total}}\n\\]\nWhat outer() does here is multiply each row total with each column total, producing a matrix of numerators. Then we divide each by the grand total to get expected counts under the null hypothesis of independence.\nThese expected values are what you’d expect if location and species are unrelated. The rest of the test compares observed counts to these expectations.\n\n\nCode\nrow_totals &lt;- rowSums(bird_counts)\ncol_totals &lt;- colSums(bird_counts)\ntotal &lt;- sum(bird_counts)\n\nexpected &lt;- outer(row_totals, col_totals) / total\nexpected\n\n\n             Golden Eagle Red Kite\nGlen Affric      23.33333 26.66667\nGlen Nevis       23.33333 26.66667\nRannoch Moor     23.33333 26.66667\n\n\nStep 3: Compute chi-square statistic manually\n\n\nCode\nchisq_contrib &lt;- (bird_counts - expected)^2 / expected\nround(chisq_contrib, 2)  # Show individual contributions\n\n\n             Golden Eagle Red Kite\nGlen Affric          1.90     1.67\nGlen Nevis           0.12     0.10\nRannoch Moor         2.98     2.60\n\n\nCode\nchisq_manual &lt;- sum(chisq_contrib)\nchisq_manual  # Final chi-square value\n\n\n[1] 9.375\n\n\nStep 4 (optional): Compare to chisq.test()\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(bird_counts)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  bird_counts\nX-squared = 9.375, df = 2, p-value = 0.00921\n\n\nNote:  The two tests yield equal results.

Also note that Karl would have stopped at calculating the X-squared value. the p-values are a later invention.\n\n\nChi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test\nThis can help us answer the second question; At each location, do the species counts/proportions match our expectations?\nThis test: - Requires a single categorical variable, with expected proportions supplied\n\nTests whether observed counts match expected counts\nNo need for a two-way table; One row is fine, because we are testing whether the distribution of categories fits a given expectation at a location.\n\nSuppose you observed just Glen Affric:\n\n\nCode\nobserved &lt;- c(Golden_Eagle = 30, Red_Kite = 20)\nobserved\n\n\nGolden_Eagle     Red_Kite \n          30           20 \n\n\nLet’s say your prior ecological knowledge says:\n\nGolden eagles should be 60%\nRed kites should be 40%\n\nThen the expected should be:\n\n\nCode\nexpected &lt;- c(0.6, 0.4) * sum(observed)  # 60% and 40% of 50\nexpected\n\n\n[1] 30 20\n\n\nThen the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is:\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(x = observed, p = c(0.6, 0.4))\n\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  observed\nX-squared = 0, df = 1, p-value = 1",

For example, if we are testing whether a single set of bird species counts matches expected proportions using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test with two categories, the degrees of freedom would be 1. At the conventional 5% significance level (α = 0.05), the critical value from the chi-square distribution is 3.84. This means that if the calculated chi-square statistic exceeds 3.84, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed frequencies differ significantly from the expected ones. Conversely, if the statistic is less than or equal to 3.84, we fail to reject the null — the data are consistent with our expectations. This critical value isn’t chosen arbitrarily; it marks the point on the chi-square curve beyond which only 5% of the distribution lies. In essence, it represents the boundary of “statistical surprise”: if your data cross this boundary, the mismatch is too large to attribute to randomness alone, and thus, potentially meaningful.",

    "text": "Francis Galton loved to measure things. In the Victorian world of steam engines and gas lamps, he believed that almost everything — from the size of peas to the height of people — could be reduced to numbers. His experiments often bordered on the eccentric: he timed how fast people could whistle a tune, drew maps of “beauty” across cities, and even studied fingerprints long before they were used in forensics. But beneath the quirkiness was a powerful insight: when you measured enough individuals, a strange order seemed to emerge from the chaos.\nGalton built a contraption he called the Quincunx, a wooden board studded with rows of pegs. Drop peas in at the top, and they bounce left or right at random until they settle at the bottom. Each journey is unpredictable, but the final pattern is always the same: the peas pile up into a graceful bell curve.\nTo Galton, this was not just a toy. It was a revelation: chance does not mean chaos, but order in disguise. Nature had a hidden geometry, a gentle tug that pulled outcomes toward the centre.\nMathematicians before him, from de Moivre to Laplace, had already formalised this idea in what we now call the Central Limit Theorem: when many small random influences accumulate, the result tends to follow a normal, bell-shaped pattern. Galton’s brilliance was to make this otherwise abstract truth visible. His board gave students and scientists a way to see probability in action.\nAnd beyond this, in his studies of heredity, Galton noticed something similar: tall parents usually have children a little shorter, and short parents usually have children a little taller. He called this tendency “regression to the mean.” Different problem, same central insight — randomness, when seen in the aggregate, bends toward balance. Galton believed this curve wasn’t just a pattern in peas, but a law of life itself.\nOne of Galton’s most devoted students, Karl Pearson, carried this vision forward. Pearson admired Galton almost to the point of worship. To him, Galton was a genius who had glimpsed an underlying truth about the universe. But Pearson wanted to take it further. While Galton had focused on averages and general tendencies, Pearson asked a new question: what about relationships?\nPearson worked with Galton’s height data, comparing parents with their children. He wanted to quantify just how strongly one predicted the other. From this pursuit came the correlation coefficient — that little number between −1 and 1 that you still use today to judge the strength of an association. Suddenly, relationships in data could be expressed with precision: not just “tall parents have tall kids,” but “the relationship is this strong.” It was a stunning leap forward.\nBut there was a catch. Pearson took Galton’s rough idea of correlation and hammered it into precise formulas. Yet the mathematics behaved most beautifully when the data followed the smooth, symmetric bell curve that Galton had idolised with his Quincunx. If your data wandered too far from that shape (skewed, heavy-tailed, or lopsided), the formulas could mislead.\nIn other words, Pearson’s correlation was born in the shadow of Galton’s bell curve. The apple didn’t fall far from the tree: a new science was built on the same foundation of normality. That’s why, even today, statisticians are trained to check assumptions before trusting their tests.\nHere is where the story becomes important for you today. Pearson’s brilliance was real, but he was also constrained by his teacher’s worldview. He had stood on the shoulders of a giant, but the shadow of that giant meant he looked at data through the lens of the bell curve. It is no accident that so many of the statistical tests we use still begin with the question: does your data follow a normal distribution?\nThis is why modern statistical practice is so full of caveats, assumptions, and diagnostic checks. When your software warns you that your sample is skewed, or that variances are unequal, it is pointing back to this history. Galton and Pearson built tools that assume a certain kind of order in the data. But the real world is often lopsided, messy, and resistant to those tidy shapes.\nSo what’s the point? - Those warnings from your stats software aren’t just nagging. They are echoes of Galton and Pearson, whose tools only worked cleanly under the bell curve.\n\nWhen you check for normality, you’re not blindly following rules — you’re asking whether your data is playing by the rules that Galton’s Quincunx and Pearson’s formulas assumed.\nAnd when the rules break, you’re stepping into the same dilemma they faced: how far can we trust conclusions built on a geometry of symmetry, when real life so often bends and skews away from the centre?\n\nThe story of Galton and Pearson is a story about genius — but also about limitation. The bell curve is elegant, powerful, and deeply useful. Yet it is not reality itself. It is an approximation. And to be a good statistician is not only to use the tools they gave us, but to know when their assumptions begin to crack.",

    "text": "We have developed a new high-potential enhancer of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) with nanotechnology which we believe can revolutionalise agriculture. It works by fostering long term relationships between beneficial soil microbes and plants. The technology works by affecting the gene expression of certain nitrogen-fixing bacteria such that they react to the presence of certain root exudates from a plant, and the presence of other bacteria that have been exposed to the same species in the past. This “wakes-up” dormant nitrogen fixing bacteria in a soil at an early crop growth stage, contributing to higher net BNF in the soil and better outcomes for the crop. Essentially, the nanotechnology builds a microbe-based memory system that allows for plants to be regrown in the same soil and with an enhanced chance of early BNF. We tested our nanotechnology against a no-treatment control and a regular BNF inoculant in randomized and replicated experiments with soya bean in 2016 and 2017. The experiments were randomized once, so the treatments occurred in the same exact plot in both years. The nanotechnology was only applied in 2016, so that we can examine if the effect lasts into 2017. Our hypothesis is that our treatment will outperform the regular BNF inoculant and the untreated control in yield in both years. We also hypothesise that the yield of the nanotechnology treatment on the same plot will improve in the second year. Finally, we believe that the regular BNF inoculation is still better than the control because these soils have poor nitrogen fixing bacteria due to excessive monocropping with cereals overtime.\nUsing the attached tidy data, please formulate appropriate null hypotheses to test our three alternate hypotheses. Conduct a statistical analysis based on the ANOVA technique and report whether our hypotheses are true or not. Conduct all the analysis in R and document the code comprehensively in a Quarto document.\nData"
